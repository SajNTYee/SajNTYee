## About Me
I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a passion for collaborative problem-solving, continuous learning, and overcoming challenges in a dynamic industry. Motivated by both personal interest and a commitment to growth, I enrolled and completed the Cybersecurity certification course from the [Centre For Cybersecurity](https://www.centreforcybersecurity.com/en-sg)  I aim to leverage my academic foundation and practical experience to support team efforts, embrace complex challenges, and contribute meaningfully to organizational security. 

## Projects
These are some of the individual home labs I've done during my time of study *(links to the projects will be up soon)*:

### Project Shadow Sentry (SOC Lab Project)
Designed and implemented a virtual SOC lab to detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity threats. Configured pfSense with multi-interface network segmentation (WAN, LAN, DMZ) and deployed Snort for intrusion detection and prevention. Set up a Windows Domain Controller for DHCP, AD DS, and security policy management, and installed an ELK stack on Ubuntu for centralized log analysis. Deployed Cowrie honeypot in the DMZ with NAT forwarding to capture malicious activity, forwarding logs to Elasticsearch via Filebeat. Created and executed pentesting scripts for ping scans, port scans, and SSH brute force attacks, monitored alerts in Kibana, and refined Snort detection rules for threat mitigation.

### Project Vulner (Penetration Testing)
Designed a Python-based network security auditing tool incorporating Nmap for scanning, Hydra and Medusa for credential testing, and Searchsploit for vulnerability analysis. Implemented user-friendly features like input validation, real-time logging, and customizable reports, with optimizations for efficiency on large networks. Delivered comprehensive documentation to support usability and troubleshooting.

### Log Analyzer (Python Fundamental)
Operation Log Recon is a Python-based project focused on parsing and analyzing /var/log/auth.log to extract actionable insights for system operations and security. The tool aims to empower cybersecurity teams by enhancing their ability to identify and mitigate threats, ensuring the integrity and resilience of system operations.

### Remote Control (Network Research) 
Developed a BASH script that runs locally and executes tasks on a remote server anonymously. The script handles installation checks, anonymity verification, port scanning, and WHOIS queries, saving results and logs for review. It captures and analyzes network traffic during the automated tasks using tcpdump and Wireshark. 

<br>

### Info Extractor (Linux Fundamental) 
Developed a BASH script to generate system diagnostic reports, covering disk usage, network details, CPU and memory usage, and large file analysis. Leveraged tools like curl, ifconfig, ps, and free to provide insights for IP identification, resource utilization, service evaluation, and storage management, enhancing system performance and cybersecurity.

### Net Crafts (Intro to Cybersecurity) 
This report details a reconnaissance mission assessing the security of a home network through Network, OSINT, and Wireshark analysis. It outlines methods, findings, and recommendations to identify vulnerabilities and enhance network security.
